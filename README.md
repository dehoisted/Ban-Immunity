# Discord-Ban-Immunity
Discord exploit allowing you to be unbannable. 9/3/2021

Found in late August.                                                                                                                                                
Found by [Passive](https://github.com/Passive) and [Me](https://github.com/dehoisted).

# Explanation
If a user gets banned at the **same time** that they join a server, Discord seems to **still** think the user is banned.                                               
Hence why the user won't work, however, kicking the user from the server may work.

# Code
The exploit is difficult to replicate code-wise, so there is no POC source yet.                                                                                       
If you make a working POC source, then make a pull request with the source [here](https://github.com/dehoisted/Ban-Immunity). (any programming language)
